# API Reference

This file is no longer the primary source for API documentation.

For a complete and up-to-date API reference, please see our full documentation, which is auto-generated from the source code to ensure accuracy.

**Note:** The documentation will be hosted at a future URL. For now, you can build it locally by navigating to the `docs` directory and running `make html`. The main page for the API reference will be `modules.html`.
